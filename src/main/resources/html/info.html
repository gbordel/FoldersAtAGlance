        <h1>Folders-at-a-glance</h1>
        <h2>version beta.0</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The aim of the application is to provide direct access to folders in the file system by a fully customizable 2D image of it.
            The rationale is to allow to see in a blink of an eye just the most salient folfers for you and to be able to open the desired one with a click.</p>
            <p>The folders are displayed as rounded rectangles that can be situated in any place of the 2D app area and can be colored to highlihgt different "clusters" of them.
                Relationships between folders (in the tree structure of the file system) are shown by means of connecting directed lines (form ancestors to descendents), where
                solid ones represent direct relation and dashed ones represents a gap in between</p>
            <p>Funcionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CLICK: Clicking on a folder will open the file system explorer in the corresponding folder, and iconify the app</li>
                <li>LOAD/SAVE: The configuration is load-from/saved-to a file at user-home-folder/AppData/Local/FAAG_Config.xml. 
                    Both actions are available at the context menus, and "save" is always a user decision. If changes are made, the user is warned before the app closes.
                    If the configuration file is not present, the app will show all the roots of the file system. </li>
                <li>DRAGGING FOLDERS : You can change a folder placement by dragging it using the mouse. If you press "CTL" key simultaneously, all the subtree will be dragged.</li>
                <li>CHANGING COLORS: the folder context menu gives option to change its text and background colors. Another menu option allows propagate these colors to all the subtrie.</li>
                <li>SHOWING NEW FOLDERS: the folder context menu gives option to open a filechooser and do a multiple selection of folders to be included in the app.
                    They appear overlapped to the original folder in a cascade placement, to be manually distributed by the user.
                    (In fact you can browse to a completely different point in the file system to select any set of folders and they will be displayed consistentely)</li>
                <li>HIDING FOLDERS: the folder context menu gives options to eliminate a folder or a whole subtree of folders from the display</li>
                <li>CHANGING THE LABEL: Initially the folder labels correspond to their names in the file system, but you can chage it through the folder context menu.</li>
                <li>HIGHLIGHTING/SEARCHING FOLDERS: You can write into the textfield in the upper right corner. All the folders than do not contain the text you enter are darkened.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>TODO list</h2>  
             <ul>
                 <li>This app is crying out for a change from Swing to FX</li>
                 <li>Multiple folder selection to apply apply changes.</li>
                 <li>Undo/redo</li>
                 <li>Auto-placement alternatives</li>
             </ul>
         </div>
